# Background 
With the tech industry evolving rapidly, the role of a **Data Analyst** has become more vital than ever.
I wanted to understand what employers are really looking for â€” **the skills, the tools, and the pay** that comes with it.

This project was born from that curiosity â€” to decode real job data and uncover valuable trends for anyone entering the data space.ðŸ’¡
As a student aiming to break into the data world,
## These are some of the questions I had:

1. What are the top-paying Data Analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for the top-paying Data jobs?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for Data Analysts specifically?
4. What are the top skills based on salary?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn (high demand and high paying skill)?

To answer these, I turned real job posting data into a structured analysis.ðŸ“Š
This project is my way of learning from the job market itself.

# Tools I Use 
To carry out this project smoothly and efficiently, I relied on a set of powerful tools commonly used in real-world data projects:

- **SQL** â€“ The core language used to query and analyze the job market data.

- **PostgreSQL** â€“ The database system used to store and process large job postings datasets efficiently.

- **Visual Studio Code** â€“ My go-to code editor for writing, testing, and debugging SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub** â€“ For version control and showcasing this project on my GitHub portfolio.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:

## 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs 
I filtered remote Data Analyst roles with available salary data and sorted them by average annual pay to find the top 10 highest paying positions. This query helped highlight the best-paying roles in the current job market.

```sql 
SELECT
    job_id,
    companies.name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS job_postings
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS companies 
ON job_postings.company_id = companies.company_id 
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location= 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
### Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the top 10 highest-paying remote Data Analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Salary Range**: Salaries vary significantly, from around $180,000 up to a standout $650,000, highlighting big rewards for senior-level roles.

- **Leadership Roles Lead**: The highest-paying positions are mostly Director and Principal Data Analyst roles, showing experience and responsibility pay off.

- **Top Employers**: Companies like Meta, AT&T, and Pinterest dominate the list, indicating big tech and established firms offer the best remote salaries.

## 2. Skills Required for Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs

Using the top 10 highest-paying remote Data Analyst roles from the first query, I pulled the required skills listed for each job. This reveals the key technical and analytical skills that consistently show up in high-paying roles â€” giving a clear roadmap for what to focus on when aiming for top-tier analyst positions.

```sql 
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        companies.name AS company_name,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM
        job_postings_fact AS job_postings
    LEFT JOIN company_dim AS companies 
    ON job_postings.company_id = companies.company_id 
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location= 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs AS top_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
### Here's the breakdown of the most in-demand skills for top-paying Data Analyst jobs in 2023:
1. **SQL is Non-Negotiable:** 
    SQL was listed in every single one of the top 10 high-paying job postings. Itâ€™s the backbone of data querying, and clearly, employers expect analysts to be fluent in it, no matter the company or role level.
2. **Python & Tableau Are Top Tier Add-Ons:** 
    Python appeared in 8 out of 10 roles, showing its dominance for scripting, automation, and analysis. Tableau was also featured heavily (7 roles), emphasizing the value of clear, visual data storytelling. These two together significantly boost an analystâ€™s profile.
3. **Cloud & Data Engineering Tools Give You an Edge:** 
    Tools like AWS, Azure, Snowflake, Databricks, and Power BI were found in several of the top-paying listings. These suggest that top jobs often blur into data engineering and cloud environments, where knowledge of infrastructure and pipelines is a plus.

## 3. What are the most in-demand skills for Data Analysts?
This query identifies the top 5 most frequently requested skills in all Data Analyst job postings, giving a clear picture of which skills are currently most sought-after in the job market â€” helping job seekers prioritize what to learn first.
```sql 
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home= TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
### Key Insights: Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

## 4. What Are the Top Skills Based on Salary?

This query investigates which technical skills are associated with the highest-paying Data Analyst roles. Instead of focusing on just a few top jobs, it looks at all roles with disclosed salaries, offering a broader perspective on which individual skills bring in more money across the industry.

By joining job postings with the skills data, we calculate the average salary linked to each skill and sort them to see which ones consistently lead to better compensation.

This helps answer the key question:
**"Which skills should I learn or improve if I want to increase my earning potential as a Data Analyst?"**

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg),0) AS avg_salary
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home= TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
### Hereâ€™s what we found when analyzing which skills are most associated with higher salaries in Data Analyst job listings (with specified salary data):

1. ***Niche = $$$***:
